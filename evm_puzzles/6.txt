the solution is call data 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a

because call CALLDATALOAD looks for the offset of the index in 32bytes and index is 0
and sending 0x0a will result in solidity adding trailing zeros to input to match 32bytes
but we want it at the back

so this the JUMPSET location
